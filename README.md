# Statuschecker
This app is made to keep an eye on servers status.
A report is done every 5m (cronjob) and a mail is sent to a chosen email adress if any service is going down.

In seed you will find Algolia, Facebook and Lithium (fr server), and in services, the different ways to their servers.

(Service's params json_path and web_api are for now useless, I'm planning to use them in a second version.)
